Modern Open Gl Notes:

1) We use GLEW in order to gain access to moder OpenGL functions that re inside the drivers on our graphics card
2) Rendering something on screen seems to be split into 3 parts vertex buffers, vertex attributes, and shaders
3) When we reference data in opengl that data is loaded into a buffer, which is just a chunk of memory we specify 
4) That buffer is given a certain ID number for reference

Vertext Attribute notes: 
1) In order to have our gpu actually know what to do with this data we need to use some methods to define and sort the structure of the data into 
2) There may be times in which offsets have to be defined using void pointer casts such as (const void*) 8 to specify 8 bytes
